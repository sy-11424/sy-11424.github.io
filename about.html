                <p>Hi, my name is Yi Shi, and I am a filmmaker and photographer. I am currently a freshman at UC Berkeley, studying Film and Media Studies. I am passionate about visual storytelling and exploring the art of cinematography. My goal is to one day become a director of photography.</p>
                <p>I enjoy working with various forms of visual media, including film photography, digital photography, and video editing. I also love exploring the theory behind filmmaking and screenwriting. Outside of my academic pursuits, I am interested in traveling, photography, and film production.</p>
                <p>In the future, I hope to work as a director of photography in the film industry. I aspire to create visually compelling stories that leave a lasting impact on audiences. I am always eager to collaborate on creative projects and continue learning about the evolving world of film and media.</p>
